# Communities of Practice

A Community of Practice (CoP) is a group of people who share a common interest in a topic and meet regularly to fulfill both individual and group goals. At Hack for LA, we use CoPs to share effective practices and relevant domain knowledge to help our members grow. 

All new volunteers at Hack for LA should join the relevant CoP and work on a couple of issues there to familiarize yourself with GitHub and how things work at Hack for LA. Once you have some proficiency, you will be assigned to a project. You are encouraged to continue attending CoP meetings to continue domain learning and peer to peer mentorship.
